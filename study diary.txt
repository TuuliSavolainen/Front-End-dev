Starting the course 15.1.2022

15.1. 

    Setting up the environment was relative familiar since I have used git, VSCode and npm earlier. 
    I had extensions already installed and I knew how to setup git and how to use terminal to install node-sass.
    The problem was that at fist I installed everything in wrong directory accidentally but once i 
    noticed that it was pretty straightforward to get everything work. I committed and pushed everything to git.
    I decided to use github and github desktop app since those are already familiar and I don't have to do 
    additional settings.

    I have used css before only. So scss is new to me but using it seems quite easy. 

    At this point I completed part 1. And I moved to part 2.

    Second part of the course teached a lot of new things. I have used litle css before but it is quite new to me. 
    In this video I learned many things that I have struggled in my own react project. For example I have tried to create
    home page that have backgroung image and text over it. I have managed to do that but I learned it can be done so much easier. 
    I have never used or heard about nested elements in css or those mixin elements. They seems pretty straightforward once get used to them.
    I can understand why scss is used.
