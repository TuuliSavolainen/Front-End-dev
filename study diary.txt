Starting the course 15.1.2022



Setting up the environment was relative familiar since I have used git, VSCode and npm earlier. 
I had extensions already installed and I knew how to setup git and how to use terminal to install node-sass.
The problem was that at fist I installed everything in wrong directory accidentally but once i 
noticed that it was pretty straightforward to get everything work. I committed and pushed everything to git.

I have used css before only. So scss is new to me but using it seems quite easy. 

At this point I completed part 1. And I moved to part 2.
